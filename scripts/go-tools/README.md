# External Tools Written in Go

This directory contains references to external tools written in go. The [tools.go](./tools.go) file imports the external tools that are used to make note of them. It will never be compiled into its own tool.

The external tools are built in the Makefile's execution and are stored in the `bin` directory that is created in this directory.
