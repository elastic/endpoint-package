## `@timestamp`

### Description
Date/time when the event originated.
This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
Required field for all events.

### Example

```json

<hr>

## `event`

### Description
The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.
A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | The action captured by the event.
This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | user-password-change |
| `category` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.
This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | authentication |
| `created` | `event.created` contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.
This field is distinct from `@timestamp` in that `@timestamp` typically contain the time extracted from the original event.
In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.
In case the two timestamps are identical, `@timestamp` should be used. | 2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z |
| `end` | `event.end` contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | None |
| `hash` | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | 123456789012345678901234567890ABCD |
| `id` | Unique ID to describe the event. | 8a4f500d |
| `ingested` | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.
This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event.
In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | 2016-05-23T08:05:35.101Z |
| `outcome` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | success |
| `start` | `event.start` contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | None |
| `type` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.
This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | None |

## `rule`

### Description
Rule fields are used to capture the specifics of any observer or agent rules that generate alerts or other notable events.
Examples of data sources that would populate the rule fields include: network admission control platforms, network or host IDS/IPS, network firewalls, web application firewalls, url filters, endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, etc.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | A rule ID that is unique within the scope of an agent, observer, or other entity using the rule for detection of this event. | 101 |
| `name` | The name of the rule or signature generating the event. | BLOCK_DNS_over_TLS |
### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

## `user`

### Description
The user fields describe information about the user that is relevant to the event.
Fields can have one entry or multiple entries. If a user has more than one id, provide an array that includes all of them.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique identifier of the user. | S-1-5-21-202424912787-2692429404-2351956786-1000 |
