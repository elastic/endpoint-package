## `@timestamp`

### Description
Date/time when the event originated.
This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
Required field for all events.
### Example

```json
"2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z"

## `Endpoint`

### Description
Fields describing the state of the Elastic Endpoint when an event occurs.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capabilities` | Enabled capabilities | None |
| `configuration` | Configuration fields represent the intended and applied setting for fields not part of a Policy setting This reflects what a given field is configured to do. The actual state of that same field is found in Endpoint.state | None |
| `configuration.isolation` | Configuration setting for Host Isolation from the network | None |
| `policy` | The policy fields are used to hold information about applied policy. | None |
| `policy.applied` | information about the policy that is applied | None |
| `policy.applied.id` | the id of the applied policy | None |
| `policy.applied.name` | the name of this applied policy | None |
| `policy.applied.status` | the status of the applied policy | None |
| `state` | Represents the current state of a non-policy setting These fields reflect the current status of a field, which may differ from what it is configured to be (see Endpoint.configuration) | None |
| `state.isolation` | Current network isolation state of the host | None |
| `status` | The current status of the endpoint e.g. enrolled, unenrolled. | None |

## `agent`

### Description
The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.
Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).
Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | 8a4f500d |
| `name` | Custom name of the agent.
This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | foo |
| `type` | Type of the agent.
The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | filebeat |
| `version` | Version of the agent. | 6.0.0-rc2 |

## `ecs`

### Description
Meta-information specific to ECS.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | 1.0.0 |

## `event`

### Description
The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.
A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | The action captured by the event.
This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | user-password-change |
| `category` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.
This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | authentication |
| `code` | Identification code for this event, if one exists.
Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | 4648 |
| `created` | `event.created` contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.
This field is distinct from `@timestamp` in that `@timestamp` typically contain the time extracted from the original event.
In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.
In case the two timestamps are identical, `@timestamp` should be used. | 2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z |
| `dataset` | Name of the dataset.
If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.
It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | apache.access |
| `hash` | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | 123456789012345678901234567890ABCD |
| `id` | Unique ID to describe the event. | 8a4f500d |
| `ingested` | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.
This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event.
In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | 2016-05-23T08:05:35.101Z |
| `kind` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.
The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data is coming in at a regular interval or not. | alert |
| `module` | Name of the module this data is coming from.
If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | apache |
| `outcome` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | success |
| `provider` | Source of the event.
Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | kernel |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the event.
The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | None |
| `severity` | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.
What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source.
The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | 7 |
| `type` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.
This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | None |

## `host`

### Description
A host is defined as a general computing instance.
ECS host.* fields should be populated with details about the host on which the event happened, or from which the measurement was taken. Host types include hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `architecture` | Operating system architecture. | x86_64 |
| `domain` | Name of the domain of which the host is a member.
For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | CONTOSO |
| `hostname` | Hostname of the host.
It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | None |
| `id` | Unique host id.
As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment.
Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | None |
| `ip` | Host ip addresses. | None |
| `mac` | Host MAC addresses.
The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | ["00-00-5E-00-53-23", "00-00-5E-00-53-24"] |
| `name` | Name of the host.
It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host. | None |
| `os.Ext` | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | None |
| `os.Ext.variant` | A string value or phrase that further aid to classify or qualify the operating system (OS).  For example the distribution for a Linux OS will be entered in this field. | Ubuntu |
| `os.family` | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | debian |
| `os.full` | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | Mac OS Mojave |
| `os.kernel` | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | 4.4.0-112-generic |
| `os.name` | Operating system name, without the version. | Mac OS X |
| `os.platform` | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | darwin |
| `os.type` | Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families.
If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition. | macos |
| `os.version` | Operating system version as a raw string. | 10.14.1 |
| `type` | Type of host.
For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | None |
| `uptime` | Seconds the host has been up. | 1325 |
