## `@timestamp`

### Description
Date/time when the event originated.
This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
Required field for all events.
### Example

```json
"2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z"
```
<hr>

## `message`

### Description
For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.
### Example

```json
"Hello World"
```
<hr>

## `agent`

### Description
The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.
Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ephemeral_id` | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).
This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | 8a4f500f |
| `id` | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).
Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | 8a4f500d |
| `name` | Custom name of the agent.
This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | foo |
| `type` | Type of the agent.
The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | filebeat |
| `version` | Version of the agent. | 6.0.0-rc2 |

Destination fields capture details about the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.
Destination fields are usually populated in conjunction with source fields. The source and destination fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.

## `event`

### Description
The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.
A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.
### Sub-fields
| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | The action captured by the event.
This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | user-password-change |
| `category` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.
This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | authentication |
| `code` | Identification code for this event, if one exists.
Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | 4648 |
| `created` | `event.created` contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.
This field is distinct from `@timestamp` in that `@timestamp` typically contain the time extracted from the original event.
In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.
In case the two timestamps are identical, `@timestamp` should be used. | 2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z |
| `dataset` | Name of the dataset.
If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.
It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | apache.access |
| `hash` | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | 123456789012345678901234567890ABCD |
| `id` | Unique ID to describe the event. | 8a4f500d |
| `ingested` | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.
This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event.
In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | 2016-05-23T08:05:35.101Z |
| `kind` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.
The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data is coming in at a regular interval or not. | alert |
| `module` | Name of the module this data is coming from.
If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | apache |
| `outcome` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | success |
| `provider` | Source of the event.
Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | kernel |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the event.
The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | None |
| `severity` | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.
What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source.
The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | 7 |
| `type` | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.
`event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.
This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | None |

May be filtered to protect sensitive information. | ["/usr/bin/ssh", "-l", "user", "10.0.0.16"] |
| `session_leader.args_count` | Length of the process.args array.
This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on how many arguments were provided to start a process. More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity. | 4 |
| `session_leader.command_line` | Full command line that started the process, including the absolute path to the executable, and all arguments.
Some arguments may be filtered to protect sensitive information. | /usr/bin/ssh -l user 10.0.0.16 |
| `session_leader.entity_id` | Unique identifier for the process.
The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of a process.
Constructing a globally unique identifier is a common practice to mitigate PID reuse as well as to identify a specific process over time, across multiple monitored hosts. | c2c455d9f99375d |
| `session_leader.executable` | Absolute path to the process executable. | /usr/bin/ssh |
| `session_leader.group.id` | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | None |
| `session_leader.group.name` | Name of the group. | None |
| `session_leader.interactive` | Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell.
Process interactivity is inferred from the processes file descriptors. If the character device for the controlling tty is the same as stdin and stderr for the process, the process is considered interactive.
Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY. | True |
| `session_leader.name` | Process name.
Sometimes called program name or similar. | ssh |
| `session_leader.parent.entity_id` | Unique identifier for the process.
The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of a process.

| `session_leader.parent.pid` | Process id. | 4242 |
| `session_leader.parent.session_leader.entity_id` | Unique identifier for the process.

| `session_leader.parent.session_leader.pid` | Process id. | 4242 |
| `session_leader.parent.session_leader.start` | The time the process started. | 2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z |

| `session_leader.real_user.name` | Short name or login of the user. | a.einstein |
| `session_leader.same_as_process` | This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the top level process.
For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`.
This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader)
Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true`
Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`. | True |

| `session_leader.tty.char_device.minor` | The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number; other parts of the kernel don’t use it, and merely pass it along to the driver. It is common for a driver to control several devices; the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them. | 1 |

## `source`

### Description
Source fields capture details about the sender of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.
Source fields are usually populated in conjunction with destination fields. The source and destination fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.
