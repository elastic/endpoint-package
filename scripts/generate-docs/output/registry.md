### `@timestamp`

#### Description
Date/time when the event originated.
This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
Required field for all events.
#### Example

```json
"2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z"
```
<hr>

### `message`

#### Description
For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.
#### Example

```json
"Hello World"
```
<hr>

### `Effective_process`

#### Description
These fields contain information about an effective process.
The effective process is the process that requested the a specific action, without directly performing it.
Processes can have effective parents that differ from their regular parents. For example, on Windows, "wmic process call create notepad" will ask WmiPrvSE.exe to launch notepad.exe. WmiPrvSE will be notepad's parent, but the wmic will be the effective parent.
Events can have effective processes that differ from their regular processes. For example, on Windows, "reg add \\localhost\HKLM\Software\Foo /v Data /t REG_SZ /d 123"  will result in a registry event from the Remote Registry service (svchost.exe). In this case, the effective process will be reg.exe.

```json

### `agent`

#### Description
The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.
Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.
#### Example

```json

<hr>

### `data_stream`

#### Description
Fields describing the new indexing strategy <type>-<dataset>-<namespace>
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `destination`

#### Description
Destination fields capture details about the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.
Destination fields are usually populated in conjunction with source fields. The source and destination fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `ecs`

#### Description
Meta-information specific to ECS.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `event`

#### Description
The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.
A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `group`

#### Description
The group fields are meant to represent groups that are relevant to the event.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `host`

#### Description
A host is defined as a general computing instance.
ECS host.* fields should be populated with details about the host on which the event happened, or from which the measurement was taken. Host types include hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `process`

#### Description
These fields contain information about a process.
These fields can help you correlate metrics information with a process id/name from a log message.  The `process.pid` often stays in the metric itself and is copied to the global field for correlation.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `registry`

#### Description
Fields related to Windows Registry operations.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `source`

#### Description
Source fields capture details about the sender of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.
Source fields are usually populated in conjunction with destination fields. The source and destination fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
<hr>

### `user`

#### Description
The user fields describe information about the user that is relevant to the event.
Fields can have one entry or multiple entries. If a user has more than one id, provide an array that includes all of them.
#### Example

```json
Needs example

```
