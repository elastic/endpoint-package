## Fields

### `@timestamp`

**Description**

>Date/time when the event originated.  This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.  If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.  Required field for all events.

**Example**

>2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z

### `agent.id`

**Description**

>Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).  Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.

**Example**

>8a4f500d

### `agent.type`

**Description**

>Type of the agent.  The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.

(**Example**

>endpoint

### `agent.version`

**Description**

>Version of the agent.

**Example**

>6.0.0-rc2

>us-east-1

### `container.id`

**Description**

>Unique container id.

### `container.image.hash.all`

**Description**

>An array of digests of the image the container was built on. Each digest consists of the hash algorithm and value in this format: `algorithm:value`. Algorithm names should align with the field names in the ECS hash field set.

**Example**

>[sha256:f8fefc80e3273dc756f288a63945820d6476ad64883892c771b5e2ece6bf1b26]

### `ecs.version`

**Description**

>ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.  When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.

**Example**

>1.0.0

### `elastic.agent.id`

**Description**

>Unique identifier of this elastic agent (if one exists).

**Example**

>c2a9093e-e289-4c0a-aa44-8c32a414fa7a

### `event.action`

**Description**

>The action captured by the event.  This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.

**Example**

>user-password-change

### `event.category`

**Description**

>This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.  `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.  This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories.

**Example**

>authentication

### `event.created`

**Description**

>`event.created` contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.  This field is distinct from `@timestamp` in that `@timestamp` typically contain the time extracted from the original event.  In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.  In case the two timestamps are identical, `@timestamp` should be used.

**Example**

>2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z

### `event.dataset`

**Description**

>Name of the dataset.  If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.  It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.

**Example**

>apache.access

### `event.id`

**Description**

>Unique ID to describe the event.

**Example**

>8a4f500d

### `event.kind`

**Description**

>This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.  `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.  The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data is coming in at a regular interval or not.

**Example**

>alert

### `event.module`

**Description**

>Name of the module this data is coming from.  If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module.

**Example**

>apache

### `event.outcome`

**Description**

>This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.  `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.  Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.  Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.  Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.

**Example**

>success

### `event.sequence`

**Description**

>Sequence number of the event.  The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision.

### `event.type`

**Description**

>This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.  `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.  This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.

### `host.ip`

**Description**

>Host ip addresses.

### `host.mac`

**Description**

>Host MAC addresses.  The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen.

**Example**

>macos

### `host.os.version`

**Description**

>Operating system version as a raw string.

**Example**

>10.14.1

### `message`

**Description**

>For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.

If the character device for the controlling tty is the same as stdin and stderr for the process, the process is considered interactive.  Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY.

**Example**

Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY.

>Unique identifier for the process.  The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of a process.  Constructing a globally unique identifier is a common practice to mitigate PID reuse as well as to identify a specific process over time, across multiple monitored hosts.

### `process.session_leader.same_as_process`

**Description**

>This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the top level process.  For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`.  This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader)  Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true`  Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`.

**Example**
