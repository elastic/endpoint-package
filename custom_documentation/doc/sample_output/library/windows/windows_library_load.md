<tr>
<td><code>@timestamp</code></td>
<td>Date/time when the event originated.  This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.  If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.  Required field for all events.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.action</code></td>
<td>The action captured by the event.  This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.</td>
<td><code>user-password-change</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.category</code></td>
<td>This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.  `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.  This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories.</td>
<td><code>authentication</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.created</code></td>
<td>`event.created` contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.  This field is distinct from `@timestamp` in that `@timestamp` typically contain the time extracted from the original event.  In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.  In case the two timestamps are identical, `@timestamp` should be used.</td>
<td><code>2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.dataset</code></td>
<td>Name of the dataset.  If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.  It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.</td>
<td><code>apache.access</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.id</code></td>
<td>Unique ID to describe the event.</td>
<td><code>8a4f500d</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.kind</code></td>
<td>This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.  `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.  The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data is coming in at a regular interval or not.</td>
<td><code>alert</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.module</code></td>
<td>Name of the module this data is coming from.  If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module.</td>
<td><code>apache</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.outcome</code></td>
<td>This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.  `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.  Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.  Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.  Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.</td>
<td><code>success</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.sequence</code></td>
<td>Sequence number of the event.  The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>event.type</code></td>
<td>This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.  `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.  This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.</td>
<td></td>

<tr>
<td><code>host.architecture</code></td>
<td>Operating system architecture.</td>

<tr>
<td><code>host.hostname</code></td>
<td>Hostname of the host.  It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.</td>

<td>Host ip addresses.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>host.mac</code></td>
<td>Host MAC addresses.  The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen.</td>

<td>Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families.  If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition.</td>

<td>Operating system version as a raw string.</td>
<td><code>10.14.1</code></td>

<td>For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.  For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.  If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.</td>
