    events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from
    a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server
    being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or
    more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken.
    Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device
    temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional
