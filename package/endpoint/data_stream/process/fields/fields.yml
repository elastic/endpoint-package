        For example, if process.group_leader.same_as_process = true, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under process.* like pid would be the same under process.group_leader.*

        The same applies for both process.session_leader and process.entry_leader.

        This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it''s not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document.

        e.g

        process.entity_id = process.group_leader.entity_id (top level process is the process group leader)

        OR

        process.entity_id = process.entry_leader.entity_id (top level process is the entry session leader)

        Instead these rules could be written like:

        process.group_leader.same_as_process: true

        OR

        process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true
