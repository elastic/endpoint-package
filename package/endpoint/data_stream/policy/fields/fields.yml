      description: 'Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.

        This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It''s also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event.

        In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`.'

        `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.

        The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not.'

        `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.

        Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.

        Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.

        Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.'

      description: 'Source of the event.

        Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing).'

        What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It''s up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source.

        The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.'

        `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.

        This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.'
