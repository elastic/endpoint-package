  description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

    This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.

    If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

    Required field for all events.'

  description: 'For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.

    For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

    If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.'

  description: 'The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on a host.

    Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the event happened or the measurement was taken.'
  footnote: 'Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat. For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing systems such as Logstash or APM Server.'

  description: 'The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.'

        This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It''s also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event.

        In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`.'
