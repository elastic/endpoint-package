#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.

| dll.pe.description | Internal description of the file, provided at compile-time. | keyword |
| dll.pe.product | Internal product name of the file, provided at compile-time. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

| file.Ext.code_signature.exists | Boolean to capture if a signature is present. | boolean |

| file.Ext.code_signature.subject_name | Subject name of the code signer | keyword |
| file.Ext.code_signature.trusted | Stores the trust status of the certificate chain. Validating the trust of the certificate chain may be complicated, and this field should only be populated by tools that actively check the status. | boolean |
| file.Ext.code_signature.valid | Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content. Leave unpopulated if a certificate was unchecked. | boolean |
| file.code_signature.exists | Boolean to capture if a signature is present. | boolean |
| file.code_signature.signing_id | The identifier used to sign the process. This is used to identify the application manufactured by a software vendor. The field is relevant to Apple *OS only. | keyword |
| file.code_signature.status | Additional information about the certificate status. This is useful for logging cryptographic errors with the certificate validity or trust status. Leave unpopulated if the validity or trust of the certificate was unchecked. | keyword |
| file.code_signature.subject_name | Subject name of the code signer | keyword |
| file.code_signature.team_id | The team identifier used to sign the process. This is used to identify the team or vendor of a software product. The field is relevant to Apple *OS only. | keyword |
| file.code_signature.trusted | Stores the trust status of the certificate chain. Validating the trust of the certificate chain may be complicated, and this field should only be populated by tools that actively check the status. | boolean |

Learn more at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/01/tracking-malware-import-hashing.html. | keyword |
| file.pe.original_file_name | Internal name of the file, provided at compile-time. | keyword |

| host.os.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |

| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
