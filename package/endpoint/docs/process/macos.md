#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |
| agent.version | Version of the agent. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | The cloud project identifier. Examples: Google Cloud Project id, Azure Project id. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |
| container.image.hash.all | An array of digests of the image the container was built on. Each digest consists of the hash algorithm and value in this format: `algorithm:value`. Algorithm names should align with the field names in the ECS hash field set. | keyword |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.image.tag | Container image tags. | keyword |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset name. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.continent_code | Two-letter code representing continent's name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| destination.geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| destination.geo.postal_code | Postal code associated with the location. Values appropriate for this field may also be known as a postcode or ZIP code and will vary widely from country to country. | keyword |
| destination.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.pid_ns_ino | This is the inode number of the namespace in the namespace file system (nsfs). Unsigned int inum in include/linux/ns_common.h. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| host.uptime | Seconds the host has been up. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |

| process.entry_leader.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |
| process.entry_leader.parent.entity_id | Unique identifier for the process. The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of a process. Constructing a globally unique identifier is a common practice to mitigate PID reuse as well as to identify a specific process over time, across multiple monitored hosts. | keyword |
| process.entry_leader.parent.pid | Process id. | long |

| process.entry_leader.real_user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |
| process.entry_leader.real_user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| process.entry_leader.same_as_process | This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the top level process. For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`. This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader) Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true` Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`. | boolean |

The character device's major and minor numbers can be algorithmically combined to produce the more familiar terminal identifiers such as "ttyS0" and "pts/0". For more details, please refer to the Linux kernel documentation. | long |
| process.entry_leader.tty.char_device.minor | The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number; other parts of the kernel don’t use it, and merely pass it along to the driver. It is common for a driver to control several devices; the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them. | long |

| process.group_leader.group.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |
| process.group_leader.group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| process.group_leader.interactive | Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell. Process interactivity is inferred from the processes file descriptors. If the character device for the controlling tty is the same as stdin and stderr for the process, the process is considered interactive. Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY. | boolean |

Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`. This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader) Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true` Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`. | boolean |

| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY. | boolean |

Event type: process_uid_change
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |

| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

Event type: process_gid_change
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |
| agent.version | Version of the agent. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |

| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| group.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |
| group.Ext.real | Group info prior to any setgid operations. | object |
| group.Ext.real.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |

| group.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |
| group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.boot.id | Linux boot uuid taken from /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id. Note the boot_id value from /proc may or may not be the same in containers as on the host. Some container runtimes will bind mount a new boot_id value onto the proc file in each container. | keyword |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |
| host.os.Ext.variant | A string value or phrase that further aid to classify or qualify the operating system (OS).  For example the distribution for a Linux OS will be entered in this field. | keyword |

| host.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.type | Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families.

| process.session_leader.same_as_process | This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the top level process. For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`. This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader) Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true` Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`. | boolean |

Event type: process_session_id_change
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |
| agent.version | Version of the agent. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |

| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| group.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |

| host.boot.id | Linux boot uuid taken from /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id. Note the boot_id value from /proc may or may not be the same in containers as on the host. Some container runtimes will bind mount a new boot_id value onto the proc file in each container. | keyword |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |

| host.os.type | Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families. If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition. | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.pid_ns_ino | This is the inode number of the namespace in the namespace file system (nsfs). Unsigned int inum in include/linux/ns_common.h. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| host.uptime | Seconds the host has been up. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| orchestrator.cluster.id | Unique ID of the cluster. | keyword |
| orchestrator.cluster.name | Name of the cluster. | keyword |
| orchestrator.namespace | Namespace in which the action is taking place. | keyword |

| process.session_leader.group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| process.session_leader.interactive | Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell. Process interactivity is inferred from the processes file descriptors. If the character device for the controlling tty is the same as stdin and stderr for the process, the process is considered interactive. Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY. | boolean |

| process.session_leader.real_user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| process.session_leader.same_as_process | This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the top level process. For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`. This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader) Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true` Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`. | boolean |

Event type: process_exec
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |
| agent.version | Version of the agent. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |

| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| group.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |
| group.Ext.real | Group info prior to any setgid operations. | object |
| group.Ext.real.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |

| host.boot.id | Linux boot uuid taken from /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id. Note the boot_id value from /proc may or may not be the same in containers as on the host. Some container runtimes will bind mount a new boot_id value onto the proc file in each container. | keyword |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |
| host.os.Ext.variant | A string value or phrase that further aid to classify or qualify the operating system (OS).  For example the distribution for a Linux OS will be entered in this field. | keyword |

| host.os.type | Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families. If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition. | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.pid_ns_ino | This is the inode number of the namespace in the namespace file system (nsfs). Unsigned int inum in include/linux/ns_common.h. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| host.uptime | Seconds the host has been up. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| orchestrator.cluster.id | Unique ID of the cluster. | keyword |
| orchestrator.cluster.name | Name of the cluster. | keyword |
| orchestrator.namespace | Namespace in which the action is taking place. | keyword |

Event type: process_already_running
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |
| agent.version | Version of the agent. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |

| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| group.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |

| host.boot.id | Linux boot uuid taken from /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id. Note the boot_id value from /proc may or may not be the same in containers as on the host. Some container runtimes will bind mount a new boot_id value onto the proc file in each container. | keyword |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |

If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition. | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.pid_ns_ino | This is the inode number of the namespace in the namespace file system (nsfs). Unsigned int inum in include/linux/ns_common.h. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| host.uptime | Seconds the host has been up. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |

Event type: process_termination
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |
| agent.version | Version of the agent. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | The cloud project identifier. Examples: Google Cloud Project id, Azure Project id. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |
| container.image.hash.all | An array of digests of the image the container was built on. Each digest consists of the hash algorithm and value in this format: `algorithm:value`. Algorithm names should align with the field names in the ECS hash field set. | keyword |

| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |

| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.pid_ns_ino | This is the inode number of the namespace in the namespace file system (nsfs). Unsigned int inum in include/linux/ns_common.h. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| host.uptime | Seconds the host has been up. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |

| process.entry_leader.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |
| process.entry_leader.parent.entity_id | Unique identifier for the process. The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of a process.

| process.entry_leader.real_user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| process.entry_leader.same_as_process | This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the top level process. For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`. This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader) Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true` Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`. | boolean |

Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY. | boolean |

| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

Event type: process_get_task
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |

| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event.

Event type: process_io
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |
| agent.version | Version of the agent. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |

| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| group.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |
| group.Ext.real | Group info prior to any setgid operations. | object |
| group.Ext.real.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |

| group.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |
| group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.boot.id | Linux boot uuid taken from /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id. Note the boot_id value from /proc may or may not be the same in containers as on the host. Some container runtimes will bind mount a new boot_id value onto the proc file in each container. | keyword |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |
| host.os.Ext.variant | A string value or phrase that further aid to classify or qualify the operating system (OS).  For example the distribution for a Linux OS will be entered in this field. | keyword |

| host.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.type | Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families. If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition. | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.pid_ns_ino | This is the inode number of the namespace in the namespace file system (nsfs). Unsigned int inum in include/linux/ns_common.h. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |

| process.session_leader.same_as_process | This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the top level process. For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`. This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader) Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true` Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`. | boolean |

Event type: process_unshare
#### Exported fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| agent.ephemeral_id | Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists). This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not. | keyword |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |
| agent.name | Custom name of the agent. This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from. | keyword |
| agent.type | Type of the agent. The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine. | keyword |
| agent.version | Version of the agent. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |

| destination.geo.timezone | The time zone of the location, such as IANA time zone name. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.hash | Hash (perhaps logstash fingerprint) of raw field to be able to demonstrate log integrity. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| group.Ext | Object for all custom defined fields to live in. | object |

| host.boot.id | Linux boot uuid taken from /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id. Note the boot_id value from /proc may or may not be the same in containers as on the host. Some container runtimes will bind mount a new boot_id value onto the proc file in each container. | keyword |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |

If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition. | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.pid_ns_ino | This is the inode number of the namespace in the namespace file system (nsfs). Unsigned int inum in include/linux/ns_common.h. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| host.uptime | Seconds the host has been up. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| orchestrator.cluster.id | Unique ID of the cluster. | keyword |
| orchestrator.cluster.name | Name of the cluster. | keyword |

| process.session_leader.group.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |
| process.session_leader.group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| process.session_leader.interactive | Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell. Process interactivity is inferred from the processes file descriptors. If the character device for the controlling tty is the same as stdin and stderr for the process, the process is considered interactive. Note: A non-interactive process can belong to an interactive session and is simply one that does not have open file descriptors reading the controlling TTY on FD 0 (stdin) or writing to the controlling TTY on FD 2 (stderr). A backgrounded process is still considered interactive if stdin and stderr are connected to the controlling TTY. | boolean |
| process.session_leader.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |
| process.session_leader.parent.entity_id | Unique identifier for the process. The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of a process. Constructing a globally unique identifier is a common practice to mitigate PID reuse as well as to identify a specific process over time, across multiple monitored hosts. | keyword |
| process.session_leader.parent.pid | Process id. | long |
| process.session_leader.parent.session_leader.entity_id | Unique identifier for the process. The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of a process.

| process.session_leader.real_user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |
| process.session_leader.real_user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| process.session_leader.same_as_process | This boolean is used to identify if a leader process is the same as the top level process. For example, if `process.group_leader.same_as_process = true`, it means the process event in question is the leader of its process group. Details under `process.*` like `pid` would be the same under `process.group_leader.*` The same applies for both `process.session_leader` and `process.entry_leader`. This field exists to the benefit of EQL and other rule engines since it's not possible to compare equality between two fields in a single document. e.g `process.entity_id` = `process.group_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the process group leader) OR `process.entity_id` = `process.entry_leader.entity_id` (top level process is the entry session leader) Instead these rules could be written like: `process.group_leader.same_as_process: true` OR `process.entry_leader.same_as_process: true` Note: This field is only set on `process.entry_leader`, `process.session_leader` and `process.group_leader`. | boolean |

| process.session_leader.tty.char_device.major | The major number identifies the driver associated with the device. The character device's major and minor numbers can be algorithmically combined to produce the more familiar terminal identifiers such as "ttyS0" and "pts/0". For more details, please refer to the Linux kernel documentation. | long |
| process.session_leader.tty.char_device.minor | The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number; other parts of the kernel don’t use it, and merely pass it along to the driver. It is common for a driver to control several devices; the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them. | long |
