      to be included in flow or connection analysis. Events in this subcategory will
      contain at least source and destination IP addresses, source and destination
      TCP/UDP ports, and will usually contain counts of bytes and/or packets transferred.
      Events in this subcategory may contain unidirectional or bidirectional information,
      including summary information. Use this subcategory to visualize and analyze
      network connections. Flow analysis, including Netflow, IPFIX, and other flow-related
      events fit in this subcategory. Note that firewall events from many Next-Generation
      Firewall (NGFW) devices will also fit into this subcategory.  A common filter
      for flow/connection information would be `event.category:network AND event.type:connection
      AND event.type:end` (to view or analyze all completed network connections, ignoring
      mid-flow reports). You can further distinguish connection events using the ECS
      `event.action` field, populating with values of your choosing, such as "timeout",
      or "reset".
    name: connection
  - description: The "creation" event type is used for the subset of events within
      a category that indicate that something was created. A common example is `event.category:file
      AND event.type:creation`.
    name: creation
  - description: The deletion event type is used for the subset of events within a
      category that indicate that something was deleted. A common example is `event.category:file
      AND event.type:deletion` to indicate that a file has been deleted.
    name: deletion
  - description: The denied event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate that something was denied. Common examples include `event.category:network
      AND event.type:denied` (to indicate a network firewall event for which the firewall
      disposition was to deny the connection) and `event.category:intrusion_detection
      AND event.type:denied` (to indicate a network intrusion prevention system event
      for which the IPS disposition was to deny the connection to complete). You can
      further distinguish denied operations using the ECS `event.action` field, populating
      with values of your choosing, such as "blocked", "dropped", or "quarantined".
    name: denied
  - description: The end event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate something has ended. A common example is `event.category:process
      AND event.type:end`.
    name: end
  - description: The error event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate or describe an error. A common example is `event.category:database
      AND event.type:error`. Note that pipeline errors that occur during the event
      ingestion process should not use this `event.type` value. Instead, they should
      use `event.kind:pipeline_error`.
    name: error
  - description: 'The group event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that are related to group objects. Common example: `event.category:iam AND event.type:creation
      AND event.type:group`. You can further distinguish group operations using the
      ECS `event.action` field.'
    name: group
  - description: The info event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate that they are purely informational, and don't report a state change,
      or any type of action. For example, an initial run of a file integrity monitoring
      system (FIM), where an agent reports all files under management, would fall
      into the "info" subcategory. Similarly, an event containing a dump of all currently
      running processes (as opposed to reporting that a process started/ended) would
      fall into the "info" subcategory. An additional common examples is `event.category:intrusion_detection
      AND event.type:info`.
    name: info
  - description: The installation event type is used for the subset of events within
      a category that indicate that something was installed. A common example is `event.category:package`
      AND `event.type:installation`.
    name: installation
  - description: The protocol event type is used for the subset of events within a
      category that indicate that they contain protocol details or analysis, beyond
      simply identifying the protocol. Generally, network events that contain specific
      protocol details will fall into this subcategory. A common example is `event.category:network
      AND event.type:protocol AND event.type:connection AND event.type:end` (to indicate
      that the event is a network connection event sent at the end of a connection
      that also includes a protocol detail breakdown). Note that events that only
      indicate the name or id of the protocol should not use the protocol value. Further
      note that when the protocol subcategory is used, the identified protocol is
      populated in the ECS `network.protocol` field.
    expected_event_types:
    - access
    - change
    - end
    - info
    - start
    name: protocol
  - description: The start event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate something has started. A common example is `event.category:process
      AND event.type:start`.
    name: start
  - description: 'The user event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that are related to user objects. Common example: `event.category:iam AND event.type:deletion
      AND event.type:user`. You can further distinguish user operations using the
      ECS `event.action` field.'
