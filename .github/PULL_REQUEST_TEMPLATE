## Q/A

<!-- delete any sections that are not applicable to your PR -->

### For mapping changes:

- [ ] I ran `make` after making the schema changes, and committed any generated files (in `schema/`, `generated/`)
- [ ] Does this field need to be "exceptionable"? (no longer specified in this package, this is now tracked in Kibana)
- [ ] If this is a `metadata` change, I also updated both transform destination schemas to match

### For Transform changes:

- [ ] The new transform successfully starts in Kibana
- [ ] The corresponding transform destination schema was updated if necessary
