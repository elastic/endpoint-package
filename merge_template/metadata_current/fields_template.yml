  group: 2
  description: 'The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if
    any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements
    on a host.

    Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields
    shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer
    where the event happened or the measurement was taken.'
  footnote: 'Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat.
    For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does
    not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing
    systems such as Logstash or APM Server.'
