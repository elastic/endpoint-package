        A list of observed behaviors.
          "cross-process" - the observed activity was between two processes
          "parent-child" - the observed activity was between a parent process and its child
          "native_api" - a call was made directly to the Native API rather than the Win32 API
          "direct_syscall" - a syscall instruction originated outside of the Native API layer
          "proxy_call" - the call stack may indicate of a proxied API call to mask the true source
          "sensitive_api" - executable non-image memory is unexpectedly calling a sensitive API

          "image_hooked" - an entry in the callstack appears to have been hooked
          "image_indirect_call" - an entry in the callstack was preceded by a call to a dynamically resolved function
          "image_rop" - no call instruction preceded an entry in the call stack
          "image_rwx" - an entry in the callstack is writable
          "unbacked_rwx" - an entry in the callstack is non-image and writable
          "allocate_shellcode" - a region of non-image executable memory allocated more executable memory
