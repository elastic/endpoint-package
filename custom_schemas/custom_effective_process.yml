    These fields contain information about an effective process.

    The effective process is the process that requested the a specific action, without directly performing it.

    Processes can have effective parents that differ from their regular parents.
    For example, on Windows, "wmic process call create notepad" will ask WmiPrvSE.exe to launch notepad.exe.
    WmiPrvSE will be notepad's parent, but the wmic will be the effective parent.
    
    Events can have effective processes that differ from their regular processes.
    For example, on Windows, "reg add \\localhost\HKLM\Software\Foo /v Data /t REG_SZ /d 123" 
    will result in a registry event from the Remote Registry service (svchost.exe).
    In this case, the effective process will be reg.exe.
