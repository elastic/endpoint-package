    These fields contain information about an effective process.

    The effective process is the process that requested the a specific action, without directly performing it.

    Processes can have effective parents that differ from their regular parents.
    For example, on Windows, "wmic process call create notepad" will ask WmiPrvSE.exe to launch notepad.exe.
    WmiPrvSE will be notepad's parent, but the wmic will be the effective parent.
    
    Events can have effective processes that differ from their regular processes.
    For example, on Windows, "reg add \\localhost\HKLM\Software\Foo /v Data /t REG_SZ /d 123" 
    will result in a registry event from the Remote Registry service (svchost.exe).
    In this case, the effective process will be reg.exe.

    - name: code_signature.exists
      level: core
      type: boolean
      description: Boolean to capture if a signature is present.
      example: "true"

    - name: code_signature.subject_name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: Subject name of the code signer
      example: Microsoft Corporation

    - name: code_signature.valid
      level: extended
      type: boolean
      short: Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.
      example: "true"
      description: >
        Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.

        Leave unpopulated if a certificate was unchecked.

    - name: code_signature.trusted
      level: extended
      type: boolean
      short: Stores the trust status of the certificate chain.
      example: "true"
      description: >
        Stores the trust status of the certificate chain.

        Validating the trust of the certificate chain may be complicated, and this field should only be populated
        by tools that actively check the status.

    - name: code_signature.status
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Additional information about the certificate status.
      description: >
        Additional information about the certificate status.

        This is useful for logging cryptographic errors with the certificate validity or trust status.
        Leave unpopulated if the validity or trust of the certificate was unchecked.
      example: ERROR_UNTRUSTED_ROOT

      type: keyword
      short: The identifier used to sign the binary.
      description: >
        'The identifier used to sign the binary.

        This is used to identify the application manufactured by a software vendor. The
        field is relevant to Apple *OS only.'
