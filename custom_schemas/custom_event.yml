  description: >
    The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened.
    Log events must include the time at which the thing happened.
    Examples of log events include a process starting on a host,
    a network packet being sent from a source to a destination,
    or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed.
    A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements
    and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include
    memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature.
    See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about
    metric and state events.
