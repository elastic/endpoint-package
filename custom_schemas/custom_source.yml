  description: >
    Source fields capture details about the sender of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from
    a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.
    Source fields are usually populated in conjunction with destination fields. The source and destination
    fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source
    and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the
    client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.
