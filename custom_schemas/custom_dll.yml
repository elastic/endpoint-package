    These fields contain information about code libraries dynamically loaded into processes.

    Many operating systems refer to "shared code libraries" with different names, but this field set refers to all of the following:
    * Dynamic-link library (`.dll`) commonly used on Windows
    * Shared Object (`.so`) commonly used on Unix-like operating systems
    * Dynamic library (`.dylib`) commonly used on macOS

  fields:
    - name: Ext
      level: custom
      type: object
      description: Object for all custom defined fields to live in.

    - name: Ext.mapped_address
      level: custom
      type: unsigned_long
      description: >
        The base address where this module is loaded.

    - name: Ext.mapped_size
      level: custom
      type: unsigned_long
      description: >
        The size of this module's memory mapping, in bytes.

    - name: Ext.compile_time
      level: custom
      type: date
      description: >
        Timestamp from when the module was compiled.

    - name: Ext.code_signature
      level: custom
      type: nested
      description: Nested version of ECS code_signature fieldset.

    - name: Ext.code_signature.exists
      level: custom
      type: boolean
      description: Boolean to capture if a signature is present.
      example: "true"

    - name: Ext.code_signature.subject_name
      level: custom
      type: keyword
      description: Subject name of the code signer
      example: Microsoft Corporation

    - name: Ext.code_signature.valid
      level: custom
      type: boolean
      short: Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.
      example: "true"
      description: >
        Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.

        Leave unpopulated if a certificate was unchecked.

    - name: Ext.code_signature.trusted
      level: custom
      type: boolean
      short: Stores the trust status of the certificate chain.
      example: "true"
      description: >
        Stores the trust status of the certificate chain.

        Validating the trust of the certificate chain may be complicated, and this field should only be populated
        by tools that actively check the status.


    - name: Ext.code_signature.status
      level: custom
      type: keyword
      short: Additional information about the certificate status.
      description: >
        Additional information about the certificate status.

        This is useful for logging cryptographic errors with the certificate validity or trust status.
        Leave unpopulated if the validity or trust of the certificate was unchecked.
      example: ERROR_UNTRUSTED_ROOT

    - name: Ext.load_index
      level: custom
      type: unsigned_long
      short: Number of times this DLL has been loaded into the process
      description: >
        A DLL can be loaded into a process multiple times.
        This field indicates the Nth time that this DLL has been loaded.
        
        The first load index is 1.

    - name: Ext.defense_evasions
      level: custom
      type: keyword
      short: List of defense evasions found for this DLL.
      description: >
        List of defense evasions found for this DLL.
        These defense evasions can make it harder to inspect a process and/or cause abnormal OS behavior.
        Examples tools that can cause defense evasions include KnownDlls hijacking and PPLDump.

      level: extended
      type: boolean
      short: Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.
      example: "true"
      description: >
        Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.

        Leave unpopulated if a certificate was unchecked.
