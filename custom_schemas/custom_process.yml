    - name: tty
      level: extended

        Information about the controlling TTY device. If set, the process belongs to an interactive session.

    - name: tty.char_device.major
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The TTY character device's major number.
      description: >
        The major number identifies the driver associated with the device. The character device's major and minor numbers can be algorithmically combined to produce the more familiar terminal identifiers such as "ttyS0" and "pts/0". For more details, please refer to the Linux kernel documentation.
      example: 4

    - name: tty.char_device.minor
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: The TTY character device's minor number.
      description: >
        The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number; other parts of the kernel don’t use it, and merely pass it along to the driver. It is common for a driver to control several devices; the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them.
      example: 1

    - name: tty.rows
      level: extended

      description: >
        The number of character rows in the terminal. e.g terminal height

        Terminal sizes can change, so this value reflects the maximum value for a given IO event. i.e. where event.action = 'text_output'
      example: 24

    - name: tty.columns
      level: extended
      type: long
      beta: This field is beta and subject to change.
      short: The number of character columns per line. e.g terminal width

      description: >
        A chunk of input or output (IO) from a single process.

        This field only appears on the top level process object, which is the process that wrote the output or read the input.

    - name: io.type
      level: extended

      description: >
        The type of object on which the IO action (read or write) was taken.

        Currently only 'tty' is supported. Other types may be added in the future for 'file' and 'socket' support.

        Best efforts are made to ensure complete lines are captured in these events. Assumptions should NOT be made that multiple lines will appear in the same event. TTY output may contain terminal control codes such as for cursor movement, so some string queries may not match due to terminal codes inserted between characters of a word.
