  description: >
    A file is defined as a set of information that has been created on, or has existed on a filesystem.

    File objects can be associated with host events, network events,
    and/or file events (e.g., those produced by File Integrity Monitoring [FIM] products or services).
    File fields provide details about the affected file associated with the event or metric.
