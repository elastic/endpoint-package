  description: >
    The hash fields represent different hash algorithms and their values.

    Field names for common hashes (e.g. MD5, SHA1) are predefined. Add fields for other hashes
    by lowercasing the hash algorithm name and using underscore separators as appropriate
    (snake case, e.g. sha3_512).

  reusable:
    order: 1
    top_level: false
    expected:
      - macro.collection
      - macro.project_file
      - macro.stream
