      populated.
    name: unknown
  dashed_name: event-outcome
  description: 'This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest
    level in the ECS category hierarchy.

    `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure
    from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.

    Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event
    may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.

    Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple
    logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures
    the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.

    Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example,
    this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`,
    or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.'

  allowed_values:
  - description: The access event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate that something was accessed. Common examples include `event.category:database
      AND event.type:access`, or `event.category:file AND event.type:access`. Note
      for file access, both directory listings and file opens should be included in
      this subcategory. You can further distinguish access operations using the ECS
      `event.action` field.
    name: access
  - description: 'The admin event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that are related to admin objects. For example, administrative changes within
      an IAM framework that do not specifically affect a user or group (e.g., adding
      new applications to a federation solution or connecting discrete forests in
      Active Directory) would fall into this subcategory. Common example: `event.category:iam
      AND event.type:change AND event.type:admin`. You can further distinguish admin
      operations using the ECS `event.action` field.'
    name: admin
  - description: The allowed event type is used for the subset of events within a
      category that indicate that something was allowed. Common examples include `event.category:network
      AND event.type:connection AND event.type:allowed` (to indicate a network firewall
      event for which the firewall disposition was to allow the connection to complete)
      and `event.category:intrusion_detection AND event.type:allowed` (to indicate
      a network intrusion prevention system event for which the IPS disposition was
      to allow the connection to complete). You can further distinguish allowed operations
      using the ECS `event.action` field, populating with values of your choosing,
      such as "allow", "detect", or "pass".
    name: allowed
  - description: The change event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate that something has changed. If semantics best describe an event
      as modified, then include them in this subcategory. Common examples include
      `event.category:process AND event.type:change`, and `event.category:file AND
      event.type:change`. You can further distinguish change operations using the
      ECS `event.action` field.
    name: change
  - description: Used primarily with `event.category:network` this value is used for
      the subset of network traffic that includes sufficient information for the event
      to be included in flow or connection analysis. Events in this subcategory will
      contain at least source and destination IP addresses, source and destination
      TCP/UDP ports, and will usually contain counts of bytes and/or packets transferred.
      Events in this subcategory may contain unidirectional or bidirectional information,
      including summary information. Use this subcategory to visualize and analyze
      network connections. Flow analysis, including Netflow, IPFIX, and other flow-related
      events fit in this subcategory. Note that firewall events from many Next-Generation
      Firewall (NGFW) devices will also fit into this subcategory.  A common filter
      for flow/connection information would be `event.category:network AND event.type:connection
      AND event.type:end` (to view or analyze all completed network connections, ignoring
      mid-flow reports). You can further distinguish connection events using the ECS
      `event.action` field, populating with values of your choosing, such as "timeout",
      or "reset".
    name: connection

      AND event.type:deletion` to indicate that a file has been deleted.
    name: deletion
  - description: The denied event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate that something was denied. Common examples include `event.category:network
      AND event.type:denied` (to indicate a network firewall event for which the firewall
      disposition was to deny the connection) and `event.category:intrusion_detection
      AND event.type:denied` (to indicate a network intrusion prevention system event
      for which the IPS disposition was to deny the connection to complete). You can
      further distinguish denied operations using the ECS `event.action` field, populating
      with values of your choosing, such as "blocked", "dropped", or "quarantined".
    name: denied
  - description: The end event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate something has ended. A common example is `event.category:process
      AND event.type:end`.
    name: end
  - description: The error event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate or describe an error. A common example is `event.category:database
      AND event.type:error`. Note that pipeline errors that occur during the event
      ingestion process should not use this `event.type` value. Instead, they should
      use `event.kind:pipeline_error`.
    name: error
  - description: 'The group event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that are related to group objects. Common example: `event.category:iam AND event.type:creation
      AND event.type:group`. You can further distinguish group operations using the
      ECS `event.action` field.'

  - description: 'The indicator event type is used for the subset of events within
      a category that contain details about indicators of compromise (IOCs).

      A common example is `event.category:threat AND event.type:indicator`.'
    name: indicator
  - description: The info event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate that they are purely informational, and don't report a state change,
      or any type of action. For example, an initial run of a file integrity monitoring
      system (FIM), where an agent reports all files under management, would fall
      into the "info" subcategory. Similarly, an event containing a dump of all currently
      running processes (as opposed to reporting that a process started/ended) would
      fall into the "info" subcategory. An additional common examples is `event.category:intrusion_detection
      AND event.type:info`.
    name: info
  - description: The installation event type is used for the subset of events within
      a category that indicate that something was installed. A common example is `event.category:package`
      AND `event.type:installation`.
    name: installation
  - description: The protocol event type is used for the subset of events within a
      category that indicate that they contain protocol details or analysis, beyond
      simply identifying the protocol. Generally, network events that contain specific
      protocol details will fall into this subcategory. A common example is `event.category:network
      AND event.type:protocol AND event.type:connection AND event.type:end` (to indicate
      that the event is a network connection event sent at the end of a connection
      that also includes a protocol detail breakdown). Note that events that only
      indicate the name or id of the protocol should not use the protocol value. Further
      note that when the protocol subcategory is used, the identified protocol is
      populated in the ECS `network.protocol` field.
    name: protocol
  - description: The start event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate something has started. A common example is `event.category:process
      AND event.type:start`.
    name: start
  - description: 'The user event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that are related to user objects. Common example: `event.category:iam AND event.type:deletion
