      being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or

              or group (e.g., adding new applications to a federation solution or
              connecting discrete forests in Active Directory) would fall into this

              using the ECS `event.action` field.

              in this subcategory will contain at least source and destination IP

              may contain unidirectional or bidirectional information, including summary
              information. Use this subcategory to visualize and analyze network connections.
              Flow analysis, including Netflow, IPFIX, and other flow-related events
              fit in this subcategory. Note that firewall events from many Next-Generation
              Firewall (NGFW) devices will also fit into this subcategory.  A common

              all files under management, would fall into the "info" subcategory.
              Similarly, an event containing a dump of all currently running processes
              (as opposed to reporting that a process started/ended) would fall into

              only indicate the name or id of the protocol should not use the protocol
              value. Further note that when the protocol subcategory is used, the
