    This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the

    by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

event.ingested:
  dashed_name: event-ingested
  description: 'Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.

    This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It''s
    also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time
    an agent saw the event.

    In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically
    look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`.'
