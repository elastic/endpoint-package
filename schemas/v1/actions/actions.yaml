      for which the IPS disposition was to deny the connection to complete). You can
      further distinguish denied operations using the ECS `event.action` field, populating
      with values of your choosing, such as "blocked", "dropped", or "quarantined".
    name: denied
  - description: The end event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate something has ended. A common example is `event.category:process
      AND event.type:end`.
    name: end
  - description: The error event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate or describe an error. A common example is `event.category:database
      AND event.type:error`. Note that pipeline errors that occur during the event
      ingestion process should not use this `event.type` value. Instead, they should
      use `event.kind:pipeline_error`.
    name: error
  - description: 'The group event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that are related to group objects. Common example: `event.category:iam AND event.type:creation
      AND event.type:group`. You can further distinguish group operations using the
      ECS `event.action` field.'
    name: group
  - description: 'The indicator event type is used for the subset of events within
      a category that contain details about indicators of compromise (IOCs).

      A common example is `event.category:threat AND event.type:indicator`.'
    name: indicator
  - description: The info event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate that they are purely informational, and don't report a state change,
      or any type of action. For example, an initial run of a file integrity monitoring
      system (FIM), where an agent reports all files under management, would fall
      into the "info" subcategory. Similarly, an event containing a dump of all currently
      running processes (as opposed to reporting that a process started/ended) would
      fall into the "info" subcategory. An additional common examples is `event.category:intrusion_detection
      AND event.type:info`.
    name: info
  - description: The installation event type is used for the subset of events within
      a category that indicate that something was installed. A common example is `event.category:package`
      AND `event.type:installation`.
    name: installation
  - description: The protocol event type is used for the subset of events within a
      category that indicate that they contain protocol details or analysis, beyond
      simply identifying the protocol. Generally, network events that contain specific
      protocol details will fall into this subcategory. A common example is `event.category:network
      AND event.type:protocol AND event.type:connection AND event.type:end` (to indicate
      that the event is a network connection event sent at the end of a connection
      that also includes a protocol detail breakdown). Note that events that only
      indicate the name or id of the protocol should not use the protocol value. Further
      note that when the protocol subcategory is used, the identified protocol is
      populated in the ECS `network.protocol` field.
    name: protocol
  - description: The start event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that indicate something has started. A common example is `event.category:process
      AND event.type:start`.
    name: start
  - description: 'The user event type is used for the subset of events within a category
      that are related to user objects. Common example: `event.category:iam AND event.type:deletion
      AND event.type:user`. You can further distinguish user operations using the
      ECS `event.action` field.'

  description: 'This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third
    level in the ECS category hierarchy.

    `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with
    the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate
    for single visualization.

    This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that
    fall in multiple event types.'
