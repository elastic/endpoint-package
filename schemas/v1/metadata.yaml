fields:

  - name: agent
    description: 'The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if
      any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements
      on a host.

      Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields
      shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer
      where the event happened or the measurement was taken.'
    fields:

      - name: id
        type: keyword
        description: 'Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).

          Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.'
        example: 8a4f500d

      - name: name
        type: keyword
        description: 'Custom name of the agent.

          This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for
          example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human
          readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming
          from.

          If no name is given, the name is often left empty.'
        example: foo

      - name: version
        type: keyword
        description: Version of the agent.
        example: 6.0.0-rc2

  - name: '@timestamp'
    type: date
    description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
      the event was generated by the source.

      If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
      by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      Required field for all events.'
    example: '2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z'

  - name: ecs
    description: Meta-information specific to ECS.
    fields:

      - name: version
        type: keyword
        description: 'ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required
          field and must exist in all events.

          When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different
          ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version
          of the events.'
        example: 1.0.0

  - name: elastic
    description: Holds fields and properties of data points and concepts in the elastic
      domain or namespace.
    fields:

      - name: agent
        description: The agent fields contain data about the Elastic Agent. The Elastic
          Agent is the management agent that manages other agents or process on the
          host.
        fields:

          - name: id
            type: keyword
            description: Unique identifier of this elastic agent (if one exists).
            example: c2a9093e-e289-4c0a-aa44-8c32a414fa7a

  - name: endpoint
    description: Fields describing the state of the Elastic Endpoint when an event
      occurs.
    fields:

      - name: policy

          policy.
        fields:

          - name: applied
            description: information about the policy that is applied
            fields:

              - name: id
                type: keyword
                description: the id of the applied policy

              - name: name

                description: the name of this applied policy

              - name: status
                type: keyword
                description: the status of the applied policy

  - name: event
    description: 'The event fields are used for context information about the log
      or metric event itself.

      A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened.
      Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log
      events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from
      a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server
      being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or
      more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken.
      Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device
      temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional
      details about metric and state events.'
    fields:

      - name: created
        type: date
        description: 'event.created contains the date/time when the event was first
          read by an agent, or by your pipeline.

          This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain
          the time extracted from the original event.

          In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The
          difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating
          an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used
          to monitor your agent''s or pipeline''s ability to keep up with your event
          source.

          In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.'
        example: '2016-05-23T08:05:34.857Z'

  - name: host
    description: 'A host is defined as a general computing instance.

      ECS host.* fields should be populated with details about the host on which the
      event happened, or from which the measurement was taken. Host types include
      hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes.'

      - name: id
        type: keyword
        description: 'Unique host id.

          As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your
          environment.

          Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.'

      - name: ip
        type: ip
