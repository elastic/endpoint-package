## Endpoint Event Documentation

**This documentation is still beta**

The subdirectories document all ECS fields that may exist in documents generated by Endpoint into
logs and metrics datastreams. Only fields included by Endpoint are documented, those added during
integration pipeline enrichment in Elasticsearch are not within the scope of this documentation.

Endpoint state management documents are desribed in a cross-platform way because they are largely
identical on each OS. Events are documented per-OS. Documentation for each state management or event
document includes the relevant OS(es), the data stream the document is found in, a KQL filter to
match on the document, and all the fields associated with the document.
